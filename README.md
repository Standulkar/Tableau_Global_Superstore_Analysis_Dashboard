Global Superstore Sales Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

Project Overview - This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and visualization of the Global Superstore dataset using Tableau. The goal is to derive actionable business insights related to sales 
performance, profitability, discounts, shipping modes, and regional losses, and present them through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly understand where the business 
is performing well, where it is losing money, and what strategic actions can improve profitability.

Objectives:
Analyze global sales and profit trends
Identify loss-making countries and sub-categories
Evaluate discount impact on profitability
Understand top-performing products
Analyze shipping mode usage and order distribution

Dashboard KPIs: 
The dashboard highlights the following key metrics:
Total Sales: 12.6M
Total Profit: 1.46M
Total Quantity Sold: 178K
Average Discount: 14.3%
These KPIs provide a quick executive summary of overall business performance.

Key Business Insights:
Certain countries and sub-categories consistently generate losses
Technology category contributes significantly to overall profit
High discounts do not always lead to higher profitability
Standard Class shipping is the most commonly used mode
A small number of products contribute a large share of total profit

Recommendations: 
Re-evaluate pricing and discount strategies for loss-making regions
Optimize or discontinue consistently unprofitable sub-categories
Focus marketing efforts on high-profit products
Improve cost efficiency in high-sales but low-profit areas
Review shipping strategies to balance cost vs delivery speed

Conclusion - This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive view of global sales performance and helps stakeholders make data-driven business decisions.
The insights derived can directly support profit optimization, strategic planning, and operational improvements.
